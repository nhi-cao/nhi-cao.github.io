**Persistent effects of colonial rubber plantations** [draft](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZepS7kU-Xg5VLxMZxu44IjgcLknq5Xhv/view)
Abstract: During their colonial rule of Cochinchina (now known as southern Vietnam), French settlers and companies turned deserted lands into large-scale plantations for natural rubber extraction, investing in machinery and recruiting indentured labor in the process. I examine whether the influence of colonial extraction could still be felt today in local areas’ development, exploiting variation in historical boundaries to identify causal relationship. Since plantation locations were likely to be chosen purposefully, I compare plantation and non-plantation areas that are otherwise similar in agro-climatic and locational observables and use distance to main roads constructed pre-colonialism to instrument for treatment assignment - whether an area was developed into plantation or not. I find higher levels of economic activity measured by night-time lights and higher gridded GDP in areas that used to be rubber plantations. Analyses using hamlet- and district-level data reveal positive impacts on household consumption, which seems to be driven by good educational access, local governance, an enduring rubber industry and a transition towards non-agricultural occupation.
